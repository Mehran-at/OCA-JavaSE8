/*
    Basic/Regular for loop has following form:

    for ( [ForInit] ; [Expression] ; [ForUpdate] ) {...}

    [ForInit] can be local variable initialization or the following expressions:

    Assignment

    PreIncrementExpression

    PreDecrementExpression

    PostIncrementExpression

    PostDecrementExpression

    MethodInvocation

    ClassInstanceCreationExpression

    [ForUpdate] can be following expressions:

    Assignment

    PreIncrementExpression

    PreDecrementExpression

    PostIncrementExpression

    PostDecrementExpression

    MethodInvocation

    ClassInstanceCreationExpression

    The [Expression] must have type boolean or Boolean, or a compile-time error occurs. If [Expression] is left blank,
    it evaluates to true.

    All the expressions can be left blank; for(;;) is a valid for loop and it is an infinite loop as [Expression] is
    blank and evaluates to true.

    In the given code, for both the loops, `System.out.print(...)` is used as [ForUpdate] expression, which is a
    MethodInvocation expression and hence a valid statement.

    Given code compiles successfully.

    Let's check the iterations:

    1st iteration of outer: i = 0. i < 3 evaluates to true.

        i = 1.

        1st iteration of inner: j = 0. j < 3 evaluates to true as j = 0. Boolean expression `i > ++j` = `1 > 1`
        evaluates to false. j = 1.

        2nd iteration of inner: `System.out.print(j)` prints 1 to the console. j < 3 evaluates to true as j = 1.
        Boolean expression `i > ++j` = `1 > 2` evaluates to false. j = 2.

        3rd iteration of inner: `System.out.print(j)` prints 2 to the console. j < 3 evaluates to true as j = 2.
        Boolean expression `i > ++j` = `1 > 3` evaluates to false. j = 3.

        4th iteration of inner: `System.out.print(j)` prints 3 to the console. j < 3 evaluates to false as j = 3.
        Control goes out of inner for loop and to the [ForUpdate] expression of outer loop.

    2nd iteration of outer: `System.out.print(i)` prints 1 to the console. i < 3 evaluates to true as i = 1.

        i = 2.

        1st iteration of inner: j = 0. j < 3 evaluates to true as j = 0. Boolean expression `i > ++j` = `2 > 1`
        evaluates to true. j = 1. ` break outer;` takes the control out of the outer for loop.

    Program terminates successfully after printing 1231 on to the console.
