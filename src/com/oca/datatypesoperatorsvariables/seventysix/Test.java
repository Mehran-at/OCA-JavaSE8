/*
    Basic/Regular for loop has following form:

    for ( [ForInit] ; [Expression] ; [ForUpdate] ) {...}

    [ForInit] can be local variable initialization or the following expressions:

        Assignment

        PreIncrementExpression

        PreDecrementExpression

        PostIncrementExpression

        PostDecrementExpression

        MethodInvocation

        ClassInstanceCreationExpression

    [ForUpdate] can be following expressions:

        Assignment

        PreIncrementExpression

        PreDecrementExpression

        PostIncrementExpression

        PostDecrementExpression

        MethodInvocation

        ClassInstanceCreationExpression

    The [Expression] must have type boolean or Boolean, or a compile-time error occurs. If [Expression] is left blank,
    it evaluates to true.

    All the expressions can be left blank; for(;;) is a valid for loop and it is an infinite loop as [Expression] is
    blank and evaluates to true.

    Multiple comma separated statements are allowed for [ForInit] and [ForUpdate] expressions, where as [Expression]
    must be single expression which results in boolean or Boolean.

    In the given for loop:

    [ForInit] = int x = 10, y = 11, z = 12: It is allowed. 3 variables are declared and initialized.
    x = 10, y = 11 & z = 12.

    [Expression] = y > x && z > y = (y > x) && (z > y) [Relational operator has higher precedence than logical AND].
    This expression is valid and results in boolean value.

    [ForUpdate] = y++, z -= 2. It is allowed. y is incremented by 1 and z is decremented by 2.

    Let's check the loop's iteration:

    1st iteration: x = 10, y = 11, z = 12. (y > x) && (z > y) = (11 > 10) && (12 > 11) = true && true = true. Loop's
    body is executed and prints x + y + z = 10 + 11 + 12 = 33 on to the console.

    2nd iteration: [ForUpdate] is executed.
    y = 12, z = 10. (y > x) && (z > y) = (12 > 10) && (10 > 12) = true && false = false.

    Control goes out of for loop and program terminates successfully.

    Loop's body executes once and prints 33 on to the console.
