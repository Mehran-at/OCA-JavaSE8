/*
    There is nothing inside loop body, hence loop body is blank.

    This loop executes 3 times, for i = 0, i = 1 and i = 2. For i = 3, control goes out of the for loop.

    Now, as i is declared outside for loop, hence it is accessible outside loop body.

    System.out.println(i); prints 3 to the console.
